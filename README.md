# Microservice-RentFix

Microservice-RentFix is an experimental microservices-based version of the RentFix project.
It is developed as a learning exercise to explore microservice architecture concepts
and service separation.

## Tech Stack
- Java
- Spring Boot
- REST APIs
- Maven
- MySQL

## Project Structure
The system is split into multiple services, each responsible for a specific domain,
such as:
- User management
- Property and rental management
- Maintenance management

Services communicate through RESTful APIs.

## Key Concepts Practiced
- Microservice architecture fundamentals
- Service-to-service communication
- Separation of responsibilities
- Modular backend design

## Purpose
This project was created to:
- Understand differences between monolithic and microservice architectures
- Practice designing smaller, independent services
- Gain experience with distributed backend systems

## Status
Educational project – ongoing experimentation and learning.
